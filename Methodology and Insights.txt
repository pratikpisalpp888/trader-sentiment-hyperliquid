
 Methodology
- Loaded the Fear/Greed Index dataset and the Hyperliquid historical trade dataset.
- Converted timestamps to daily dates and merged trades with sentiment on date.
- Normalized sentiment labels by mapping:
  - Extreme Fear → Fear
  - Extreme Greed → Greed
  (This improves sample size while keeping the analysis interpretable.)
- Built daily account-level metrics:
  - Daily Net PnL = sum(Closed PnL) − sum(Fee)
  - Win rate = wins / (wins + losses), win defined as Net PnL > 0 on a trade
  - Trade frequency = trades per day
  - Average trade size (USD)
  - Directional bias (BUY share)
  - Drawdown proxy using cumulative daily net PnL per account

Note: leverage was not available in the provided trade export, so behavior analysis focuses on frequency, sizing, and directional bias.

Insights (with evidence from outputs)
1) Performance shifts between Fear and Greed:
   - Daily net PnL distribution changes across sentiment regimes.
   - Win rate and drawdown proxy show different behavior under Fear vs Greed.
   Evidence: `outputs/performance_summary.csv`, `outputs/chart_pnl_dist.png`

2) Traders change behavior depending on sentiment:
   - Trade frequency differs between Fear and Greed days.
   - Average trade size and buy/sell bias also change by regime.
   Evidence: `outputs/behavior_summary.csv`, `outputs/chart_frequency.png`, `outputs/chart_size.png`

3) Segment differences are meaningful (not all traders react the same):
   - I segmented accounts into Frequent/Infrequent and Large/Small trade-size groups.
   - Segment-level mean PnL differs between Fear vs Greed.
   Evidence: `outputs/segmentation_matrix.csv`

 Strategy Recommendations (Rules of Thumb)
1) Regime-based participation:
   - On Greed days, favor the trader-style segment that historically shows the best mean net PnL during Greed (see `segmentation_matrix.csv`).
   - Practical action: allow higher activity for that segment; avoid increasing activity for segments that historically lose during Greed.

2) Defensive trading on Fear days:
   - On Fear days, reduce aggressiveness (trade size / frequency) for segments that historically show worse net PnL or deeper drawdowns.
   - Practical action: cap trade frequency and reduce size for the weaker Fear-performing segment; keep risk tighter.
